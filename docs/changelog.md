# Changelog

## [2.12.0](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/releases/tag/KeY-2.12.0) (2023-08-18)

### Breaking changes
* [The minimum required JDK version is set to 11.](https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/merge_requests/380)
- This release contains breaking changes for the reloading of older proofs:
    - Integers in specifications are now considered as unbounded (i.e. `\bigint`, math mode specifiers can be used to deviate from the default).
    - The list of rule sets used by the One-Step-Simplifier has changed.
    - JML assertions are handled as a standalone construct and not as a block contract anymore.
